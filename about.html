            <p>
              The city of Ozamiz grew out of an old Spanish town called Misamis—a name believed to have been derived from the Subanen word kuyamis, a variety of coconut. Other unverified historical sources, however, suggest that the name Misamis came from the Spanish word Misa (Catholic Mass).

The old Spanish town grew in size due to the nearby Spanish garrison stationed at the stone fort named Fuerte de la Concepcion y del Triunfo. The fort was constructed some time in 1756 in order to attempt to combat the pirate activities originating in the nearby Lanao area. In 1850, the town of Misamis became the capital of the District of Misamis.
